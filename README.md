# The Quake Report
This is the Lesson 3 version of the Quake Report App! I completed this as a part of Udacity's Android Basics Nanodegree. This app allows you to track earthquakes that occur worldwide as they are reported on the USGS website. When you click on one of the earthquake listings, it will open up the USGS site on your web browser so that you can learn more about that particular earthquake.

## Being A Udacious Coder
For this app, I made use of the USGS API. Loaders, and JSON Parsers.
